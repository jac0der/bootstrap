                        Bible study is cruicial to my daily operating. The Word of God
                        keeps me focused spiritually, which in tern keeps me aligned to God's
                        principles and also fuels my productivity.

                        The mind and body needs ample time to recover from a hard days work to replenish.
                        So I ensure I get enough rest to ensure I am energetic in facing tasks each day.
                        Rest is also just important for good overall health.

                            The mind is a muscle which needs to be kept in tip-top shape for it to be
                            at its peak ferformance. Today, a lot of convenience exists which could lead 
                            to less and less use of the humnan mind, which may lead to reduced performance 
                            of one's mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I am aware of such matter, I ensure I read regularly to exercise
                            my mind. I have no boundaries on what I read, as knowledge has no bounds really, but 
                            generally I read a lot of tech books and other books such as the Colin Powell 
                            autobiography I am currently reading.

                        Theoty is good to become grounded in the fundamentals. However, to truly learn a concept,
                        it needs to be stored in long term memory. To help with this, simply re-reading or re-watching 
                        a video is not very effective. When we are forced to recal is when we recognized what we really 
                        know. At times we may forget something, but this is perfectly normal and the purpose of the 
                        retrieval practice to then go back to the material to help aid recollection, hence reenforcing
                        concept in long-term memory.

                        I grew up playing football on the streets with or without shoes with firends. We played on concrete 
                        surfaces as well as on fields for the love of the sport. Every Saturday morning it's game time with
                        a few young men from the community, as I try to show them a different aspect of life apart from the 
                        negative options portrayed in our society today. I also enjoy playing basketball as well.

                        to keep fit and to take a break from work. I also like cycling as it is an easy way to go around town, rather 
                        than driving small distances which uses petrol, I ride instead, and also get a workout just to head in the town.
                        Cycling is just fun, especially at really high speeds, but ofcourse I am careful.

                    Dunn's River Falls was my backyard while growing up so I would visit multiple times per month with my 
                    friends, especially during the holidays. The falls is <span class="fw-bold text-red">magnificent</span> and the water is rather cold. On each
                    visit I would run up the falls atleast five times which was quite the work out. Dunn's River is an 
                    extremely delightful experience you have to enjoy atleast once. There are many other other spots to enjoy  
                    outdoors, such as White River rafting, ATV riding, ziplining, river tubing and horseback riding at Chuckka.
                    I believe in enjoying the beauty of my Island, its not just for Tourists. There are numberous places to visit,
                    to name a few: Blue Hole, Mystic Mountain, Reach Falls, <span class="text-primary fw-bold fs-4">7 Mile Beach in Negril</span>, YS Falls, Doctors Cave Beach,

                    I am fairly adventurous when it comes to food. I love trying new types of food, but I am easily
                    turned off if food is not properly prepared. Presentation is also a plus but not my first concern 
                    in certain situations. Food should be seasoned and cooked properly. Jamaica is well known for having
                    a great food such as <span class="text-dark fw-bold fs-4">Ackee and saltfish</span>, 
                    <span class="text-dark fw-bold fs-4">Jerked Chicken</span> and the <span class="text-dark fw-bold fs-4">Patties</span>. 
                    There is also great street food options by the locals at apecific spots or the pushcart soup vendors. Different coultures 
                    such as the Chineese, Indians and Jewish along with other ethinic gorups have also incorporated their traditional dishes 
                    with a Jamaican twist. All in all, great food is on the Island.
